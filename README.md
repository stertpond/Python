# Getting Started with Python

Hi Maddy, 
If you wish to learn basic programming skills with Python - which I strongly recommend you do - I suggest the following approach:
1. Install Visual Studio Code (VS Code)
2. Install Python Extension for VS Code and the Python compiler

Below, is some guidance on how to do this. 
Any problems, give me a call

## Install Visual Studio Code

VS Code is a free, lightweight but very powerful file editor from Microsoft that can be used for writing small (and large) programs. 
Be warned, initially there is a bit of a learning curve to be mastered here, however, this is definitly worth the effort and should not take you long - don't give up as VS Code is worth knowing even if you do not want to code!!

Install VS Code as follows:
1. Download from [vs code site](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs#vscode). Select the Download button and then run the installer on your PC, following the instructions provided.
2. Once installed, verify that you can open the program `Start => Visual Studio Code`
3. I also recommend you add shortcut to the Windows Task bar to make accessing the program easier.

## Install Python Extension and Compiler

Instructions are available [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/python-tutorial).
Follow these carefully, noting the following:
- You will need to install a Python compiler as explained [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/python-tutorial#_install-a-python-interpreter). I downloaded the compiler from [python org](https://www.python.org/downloads/) as recomended - click the download button and then run the installer program.
- Read [this](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/python-tutorial#_verify-the-python-installation) to verify the Extension and Compiler are correctly installed 

# Create your first (very simple) Python program
The aim here is to verify things are working correctly by writing a very simple program to print the words "Hello World". 
How to do this is explained [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/python-tutorial#_install-a-python-interpreter).

# Git and Source Code Respository
This file, together with my example Python programs (`Risk.py` and `HelloMaddy.py`), are stored in an online source code repository know as [GitHub](https://github.com/).
GitHub is the worlds largest source code repository and is accessible to everyone at no charge. It provides an easy and effective way to share source code.
It also works very well with VS Code.
Once you have got the Python working with VS Code then we can look at sharing code using Git. :)

Happy coding!!!
