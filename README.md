# Getting Started with Python

To learn Python, I recommend the following approach:
1. Install Visual Studio Code (VS Code)
2. Install Python Extension for VS Code - this will make sense one VS Code is installed
3. Install Python Compiler

## Install Visual Studio Code

VS Code is a free, lightweight but very powerful file editor from Microsoft that can be used for writing applications. Although there is a bit learning curve to be mastered initially, it is worth the effort and should not take long - don't give up.

1. Download from https://code.visualstudio.com/docs#vscode and follow the instructions

## Install Python Extension

Setting up the extension is explained here https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/python-tutorial

## Install Python Compiler / Interpreter
